/// @notice A bonded arbiter for Circle's Refund Protocol.
///
/// Refund Protocol gives the arbiter seat unchecked power: whoever holds it can refund a payment
/// on a whim, and Circle's own README flags that an arbiter can drain payments through early
/// withdrawal. This contract takes that seat and gives it back constraints:
///
///   1. Evidence comes from the parties, not the arbiter. A payer or a merchant files
///      `sha256(their evidence)` under their own key with `fileEvidence`, before any ruling.
///      A filed record is immutable, and the arbiter cannot file on its own behalf.
///   2. Commit first. Ruling names WHOSE filed evidence it acted on and the hash it read, so the
///      reasoning exists before the money moves and cannot be rewritten afterwards.
///   3. Stake. Every ruling is backed by native value held here, reclaimable only once the
///      challenge window has passed without a successful challenge. `minBond` must stay well
///      above what a challenge costs in gas on the chain it runs on — a bond that does not
///      cover the challenger's gas buys no scrutiny, however slashable it is on paper.
///   4. Slashable, with nothing to forge. `challenge` takes no evidence from the caller: it
///      compares the hash the arbiter cited against the hash that party actually filed. Cite
///      evidence nobody filed, or a different version of it, and anyone takes the bond.
///
/// The contract never holds user payments. It only acts on Refund Protocol, so the worst an
/// operator can do is rule wrongly, and that costs the bond.
